# GigFloww Landing Page

This is a simple landing page that I have created for the GigFloww platform. This was given as part of the internship assignment where a responsive and clean UI design had to be made.

##  What have I created

- Hero section with heading and call-to-action button
- About section in which a little introduction has been given
- 4 feature blocks have been told for the benefits of the platform
- The whole layout is responsive - works well on both mobile + desktop

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox and a little Grid have been used)
- No framework or JS has been used, made it simple and clean
